## Description
DFD35X is an open-source project started by Digital Flight Dynamics in order to create a realistic and high-quality Airbus A350 XWB for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020.
At the moment this project is still in very early stages, so if you contribute, we would highly appreciate it. If you want to follow our frequent progress updates, join our discord server above.

## Install
Since the A35X is not released, **we do not provide support for the aircraft's installation nor do we provide builds**. However, if you would like to use the aircraft any way, you must follow this process:
1. Download the Repository
2. Extract the A35X folder to a suitable location (Not your Community Folder)
3. Enable Development Mode in MSFS
4. On the development bar at the top of your MSFS window, Click [Dev Mode] > Open Project. Select A35X > dfd35x-k.xml 
5. Right click on the A35X Folder and click "Git Bash Here" and Run the commands npm i, npm i --force, and npm run build. This generates the display files from src. (You must have npm/node.js installed)
6. In the development bar at the top of MSFS, Open Tools > Project Editor, and click build all.
7. Once the build is complete, the DFD35X will appear in your available Aircraft List.

## FAQ
**1. When will the DFD35X project be released as Version 1.0?**  
The aircraft will release when models & systems are complete, and polished to the point where it has little to no bugs.  
  
**2. Will this aircraft be study-level?**  
Study-level is a term that is overused in flight simulation. It's basically like clickbait on a YouTube video but for FS aircraft addons. However I can assure you that the systems will be close to real life to have maximum immersion.  
  
**3. Will it have a custom cockpit?**  
Yes. This addon will have a highly accurate custom cockpit, as opposed to most other current addons that use the default cockpits from other aircraft.  

**4. How can I contribute?**  
Please read our [Contributing Guide](.github/Contributing.md).
